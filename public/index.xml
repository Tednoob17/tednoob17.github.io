      <description>MAPPING CODE TO ATTACK SURFACE Once we know where we are, then the world becomes as narrow as a map.&#xA;When we don’t know, the world feels unlimited. Liu Cixin, The Dark Forest&#xA;Introduction Attack surface (the potential entry points to exploit a vulnerability) going often with the growing of complexity of software.&#xA;The vulnerabilities to be introduced, as developers’ capacity to properly secure these feature is limited and mistakes are inevitable when dealing with millions of lines of code.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone this is the first serie of my notes and my recap of the awesome/incredible book From Day Zerp to Zero Day written by Eugene &amp;ldquo;Spaceraccoon&amp;rdquo; Lim a security researcher and white-hat hacker.&#xA;He learned rapidly because his first training was in how to learn. - Frank Herbert, Dune.&#xA;With the number of discovered and exploited zero days constantly growing, vulnerability research, or the process of analyzing systems for new vulnerabilities, has zero to zero assumed a critical role in cybersecurity.</description>
