I'm Ted **"Tedsig42"** Regis Kouhouenou, a 22-year-old cybersecurity enthusiast, CTF player, music lover, and artist.    
I have spent much of my time at schools such as **42 School**, **Epitech**, and **Holberton School**.    
I spend my **free time** on **web security research** and recently started **bug bounty hunting**.    
From time to time, I contribute to **open source** projects such as [Exegol](https://exegol.com/), [The Hacker Recipes](https://www.thehacker.recipes/), [Payload All The Things](https://swisskyrepo.github.io/PayloadsAllTheThings/), and other open source projects, especially when I **submit patches for vulnerabilities I discover**.    
I play CTF and collaborate with the [@TheBugsReapers](https://thebugsreapers.com) **vulnerability researcher/bug hunter team**.     
I strive to share what I have learned on my blog [tedsig42.re](https://tednoob17.github.io/), which includes CTF writeups, research projects, and more.

**Currently self-employed, but open to new opportunities.**
