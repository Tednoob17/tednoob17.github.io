I'm Ted **"Tedsig42"** Regis Kouhouenou, a young **Cybersecurity Enthusiast**,  CTF player, music lover, artist, 22 yo.    
I spend much of my time at schools like **42 School**, **Epitech**, **Holberton School**.
I spend my free time on **Web Security Research**, and recently started **Bug Bounty**.   
From time to time, I **contribute** to certain **open source** projects such as  [Exegol](https://exegol.com/), [The Hacker Recipes](https://www.thehacker.recipes/) and [Payload all the things](https://swisskyrepo.github.io/PayloadsAllTheThings/).   
I play CTF and collaborate with the [@TheBugsReapers](https://thebugsreapers.com) **Vulnerability Researcher** / **Bug Hunter** team.  
I strive to provide as much information as I can about what I have learned on my blog [tedsig42.re](https://tednoob17.github.io/), which encompasses CTF writeups, **research projects**, and more.
