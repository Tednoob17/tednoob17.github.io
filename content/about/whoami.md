I'm Ted **"Tedsig42"** Regis, a young **Cybersecurity Enthusiast**,  CTF player, music lover, drawer.    
I spend any of my free time on Web Security Reseach .    
I play CTF and collaborate with [@TheBugsReapers](https://thebugsreapers.com) Vulnerability Researcher / Bug Hunter team .  
I strive to provide as much information as I can about what I have learned on my blog [tedsig42.re](https://tednoob17.github.io/), which encompasses CTF writeups, research projects, and more.
