# MAPPING CODE TO ATTACK SURFACE   

Once we know where we are, then the world becomes as narrow as a map.  
When we don’t know, the world feels unlimited.
`Liu Cixin, The Dark Forest`

## Introduction
**Attack surface** (the potential entry points to exploit a vulnerability) going often with the growing
of **complexity** of software.  
The **vulnerabilities** to be introduced, as developers’ capacity to **properly secure** these feature is
limited and mistakes are **inevitable** when dealing with millions of lines of code.  
Minor issues can be **chained** together into far more serious **vulnerabilities**.  

For example :
- Microsoft Excel handles not only Excel workbook file format (`.xls`, `.xlsx`, `.xlsm`, `.xls`) but also Symbolic Link (`.slk`), dBase (`.dbf`), Data Interchange
Format (`.dif`), and more.
And these are just **file input vectors**; you also have
to worry about **[inter-process](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-systems/inter-process-communication-ipc/)** communication and other network vectors (Inter-Process Communication or IPC is a mechanism that allows processes to **communicate**. It helps processes **synchronize their activities**, **share information**, and **avoid conflicts** while accessing **shared resources**.).    
For example, another process may control Excel via **[Component Object Model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/com/component-object-model--com--portal)**
(COM) interfaces  (These objects can be within a single process, in other **processes**, even on **remote computers**.), or it may fetch data from the **internet** via external data
connections.   
These are all potential **sources for exploitable vulnerabilities** .

## The Internet
In the past, native and web applications lived in separate worlds:  
- Native **applications** were **compiled** into machine **code binaries** that ran on specific devices and platforms.
- Web applications were mostly written in **web development languages** .
They had vastly different **attack surfaces** and **exploit vectors**.

## Web Client Vulnerabilities
**Client-side vulnerabilities** are especially for software running on **native devices**, such as **desktop or mobile applications**  

### Attack Vectors

The possible **attack vectors** vary depending on how the software **parses the data**.  
The **attack surface** also depends on whether and to what extent an attacker **controls the destination** the **software** is connecting to.  
These factors will affect the scope of your source code analysis
and the types of potential vulnerabilities you should look out for.  

A man-in-the-middle (**MITM**) is often required for exploiting  any vulnerability when software is running on a hardcoded **URL** 
This assumes some level of control over the network or device
that the software is running on.  

Exemple : 

- Nintendo Switch - WebKit Code Execution:   
CVE-2016-4657 **web-kit vulnerability** for ios 9.3, **nintendo switch browser** vulnerability
( i know whats running in your mind nintendo switch has no no **browser**, but when you need to use a wifi which needs to be conformed by logging in to the browser)
a **memory corruption** in webkit .  
To **hijack** this flow, an attacker
could modify the **Domain Name System** (DNS) settings of the **Switch** (or the
**router** it’s connected to), rerouting it to an **attacker-controlled** web server
hosting a **payload** designed to **exploit CVE-2016-4657**.

- Reverse Engineering to Facebook Gameroom :  
The **Facebook Gameroom** desktop **application** use the custom uniform resource identifier (**URI**) scheme `fbgame://gameid/`
it registered could be **manipulated** to cause the application to **navigate** to different pages on `https://apps.facebook.com` in its embedded Chromium-based browser.  
By exploiting a few **redirection gadgets** on that domain, It was able to redirect back
to the own **attacker-controlled payload** on a **different domain** that triggered a
**memory corruption** vulnerability (**CVE-2018-6056**) on the **outdated** version off Chromium.  
The **combination** of a local **input vector** (in this case, the **custom URI
scheme**) and a **web-based gadget** chain (redirections in `apps.facebook.com`) is
an increasingly common exploit pattern due to the growing prevalence of
(often outdated) **embedded browsers** in desktop applications.

### Identification and Classification

You can **identify** and **classify** web client **functionality** in code by searching for
**web-related** application programming interfaces (**APIs**) and **library** function
calls in the source code.  
Developers often use **libraries** to simplify common
tasks like making **web requests** and **parsing** their responses.   

For example, in previous exemple (about **Facebook Gameroom**) the **researcher ([Eugene Lim](https://spaceraccoon.dev/))** determined that Facebook Gameroom included an
embedded browser because it imported `CefSharp.dll`, a `.NET`  **wrapper** for
the **Chromium** Embedded Framework.  
By **tracing** the **usage** of `CefSharp`
**APIs** in the **decompiled** `C#` code, he identified the most **pertinent** sections
that make up the **web client attack surface** of the application.

```c#
# example code to load and render a web page offscreen with CefSharp.

using System;
using CefSharp;
using CefSharp.OffScreen;

class Program
{
	static void
	(string[] args)
	{
		const string testUrl = "https://www.google.com/";
		Cef.Initialize(new CefSettings());
		var browser = new ChromiumWebBrowser();
		browser.Load(testUrl); // 1
		Console.ReadKey();
		Cef.Shutdown();
	}
}

# A simple CefSharp offscreen client
```

After any research we found that : `ChromiumWebBrowser()` refers to a **class constructor** used in **CefSharp**, an open-source framework that allows **embedding a full-featured web browser** into `.NET` applications (`C#` or `VB.NET`).
This is API call (`//1`) is a possible attack vector via a attacker-controlled url.
But it's important to highlight an important point: **When identifying the attack surface of software at
the macro level, the distinction between sources and sinks becomes blurred.**  
The key idea is that some **functions**, while **not directly receiving data from a user** (a source), use that **data to perform an action** (a sink).   

Simple Example:   
Imagine a program that takes a **URL** as **input** and **displays** the webpage.  

>  - A user **enters a URL** like https://www.google.com/.  
>  - The **program uses a function** like `browser.Load(user_input_url)`  .  
>  - An **attacker** could **enter a malicious URL** like https://malicious-site.com/  which could **lead to a server-side request forgery (SSRF)** vulnerability or other attacks, where the server is tricked into making a request it shouldn't.

The "**blur**" happens because a function can act as both. 

### Web Server Vulnerabilities
Web server or client containing a lot of vulnerabilities, and all of devices when it use it also, like **Iot** devices.

### >  Web Frameworks
Web application framework (WAF) is a software framework that is designed to support the development of web applications including web services, web resources, and web APIs.  
Many web frameworks provide libraries for database access, templating frameworks, and session management, and they often promote code reuse.  

Source : [Web Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_framework)

Consider this piece of code, which is a `Node.js` web server that exposes a few **routes** using the standard **http library**.

>   `httpserver.js`

```js
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
	res.statusCode = 200;
 	if (req.method === 'GET') { //1
		if (req.url === '/') {
			return res.end('index');
		}
		if (req.url === '/items') {
			return res.end('read all items');
		}

		if (req.url.startsWith('/items/')) { //2
			const id = req.url.split('/')[2];
			return res.end(`read item ${id}`);
		}
		} else if (req.method === 'POST') {
			if (req.url === '/items') {
				return res.end('create an item');
			}
		}
		res.statusCode = 404;
		return res.end();
	});
	server.listen(8080, () => {
	console.log('Server running at http://localhost:8080/');
});
```
> A vanilla Node.js web server

- It's difficulties of maintaining the code of large web applications without a web framework
- Distinguishing between `GET` and `POST` **routes** relies on clumsy nested conditional statements (`//1`), while fragile string
operations are used to **extract path parameters** like `userId` (`//2`).

Now compare it to another Framework (`Express`)

> `expressserver.js`

```js

const express = require('express');
const app = express();

const itemsRouter = express.Router();
itemsRouter.get('/', (req, res) => { //1
	res.send('read all items');
});
itemsRouter.post('/', (req, res) => {
	res.send('create an item');
});
itemsRouter.get('/:id', (req, res) => {
	const { id } = req.params; //2
	res.send(`read item ${id}`);
});
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
	res.send('index');
});
app.use('/items', itemsRouter);

app.listen(8080, () => {
	console.log('Server running at http://localhost:8080/');
});

```

> A web server built on the Express framework

Not only does **Express** do the same thing with **less code**, it also abstracts
away common tasks like **checking the request method** (`//1`), **extracting path
parameters** (`//2`), and **handling nonexistent routes**.

**Web frameworks** create opportunities to **refactor code**, such as **moving
nested routes** under `/items` to another file. This makes the code **easier to
read** both for developers and for you, the aspiring **vulnerability researcher**.

### >  The Model–View–Controller Architecture

One common pattern among **web frameworks** is the **Model–View–Controller**
(`MVC`) architecture, which separates the code into **three main groups**.

Familiarity with this **pattern** will help you quickly **analyze frameworks**, understand
the **flow of data** through **sources and sinks**, and **focus** on the **critical business logic** that is most likely to **contain vulnerabilities** instead of getting caught up
in **irrelevant code**.  
The **MVC architecture** comprises three parts:  

- **Model** Handles the "business logic", such as **data structures**.
- **View** Handles the **user interface**, such as **layouts and templates**.
- **Controller** Handles the **control flow** from **requests** to relevant **model**
and **view** components.


**Spring** MVC (a **Java** web framework) in were we converted a previous node app.

> `ItemController.java`

```java
@Controller
@RequestMapping("/items") //1
	public class ItemController {
		private final ItemService itemService;

		@Autowired
		public ItemController(ItemService itemService) {
			this.itemService = itemService;
		}

		@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET)
		public Map<String, Item> readAllItems() {
			return itemService.getAllItems();
		}

		@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.POST)
		public String createItem(ItemForm item) { //2
			itemService.createItem(item);
			return "redirect:/items";
		}

		@RequestMapping(value = "/{id}", method = RequestMethod.GET)
		public Map<String, Item> readItemForId( @PathVariable Int id, Model model) {
			return itemService.getItemById(id);
		}
	}
```

>  	A partial controller code snippet for Spring MVC

When you read the code it difficult to understand her
**functions** unless you’re **familiar** with the **framework’s conventions**.
- Like `@Autowired` for know her role it's important to read the **springs boot documentation**, and after reading we read that 
it's used to **enables automatic dependency injection**.  
This annotation can be placed on a **constructor**, a **method** or **directly** on an **attribute**.   
The **Spring Framework** will search for the **bean** in the **application context** whose type is applicable to each **constructor parameter**, **method parameter** or **attribute**.  

- In (`//2`), note the function `createItem` **returns** `redirect:/items` . The **redirect:** prefix **indicates** that the **route** should **redirect** to the
**URL** that comes **after it**, which in this case is `/items`.  
- But  any **function or line** are simple.  
By exemple it’s still **fairly obvious** that the `@RequestMapping` annotation 
maps a handler **method** to a particular  **request** route (`GET`, `POST`) . (`//1`)


Specially for **object-oriented programming** languages, you can encounter a **controller** who can **inherits**
 of **methods and route** of another **controller** (who often is declared in another file).


> `ThingController.java`

```js
@Controller
@RequestMapping("/things")
public class ThingController extends ItemController { //1
	@RequestMapping(value = "/price", method = RequestMethod.GET) //2
	public ModelAndView getPrice() {
		// Controller code
	}
}
```
> An extended controller class
`/things/price`  **route handler** (`//2`), this **controller inherits** the previous **routes and methods** from 
`ItemController`

### 	> Unknown or Unfamiliar Frameworks
To effectively **analyze web server**
**code regardless** of the **framework used**, focus on common **routing** and **controller logic** 
that all **web applications** must implement.

 - First, identify how the code **handles the basic** building blocks of an **HTTP request.**

Here’s a simple example of what such a **request** might look like:

```http
POST /items HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Content-Type: application/json

{
	"name": "Apple",
	"price": 1
}

```
The application needs to **parse** the following **components**:


- **Request method** : `GET` or `POST` **request** ? **Grepping** for `GET` or `POST` might yield insights or a simple string comparison or more
complex decorators like `@GetMapping`. 

- **URI** : To **locate** **routes** quickly in a **web application codebase**, look for
**URI-like** strings. If you have a **working instance** of the **application**, try
**matching** the behavior you **observe** at a particular **route** with the **code**
that handles that **route** .  
Applications **often handle [routes declaratively](https://autoroute.vercel.app/advanced/declarative_routing)**,
such as `app.get('/items')`  **instead** of `if (req.url === '/items')`.   
Understanding the **declarative convention** is *key*. Some **frameworks**, like **Ruby on Rails**, even **centralize the routing logic** in **specific files**, such as 
`config/routes.rb`.

- **Headers** : Does the application check **specific headers**? Search for common headers like `Origin` or `Content-Type`, Check all things about [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS) and [SOP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy) .

- **Parameters** : How does the code **extract parameters** from a **request**?
Other than the **request URI**, this is one of the most **common sources** of
**external input**. Parameters can come from the **HTTP request body** (like
the `JSON` content in the example request), the **query string**, or **within** the path.

Next, identify how the code handles sending HTTP responses.  

For example, after creating the **item** specified in the example **request** and **adding** it
to the **database**, the **web application** could send:


```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
Cache-Control: no-cache
{
	"id": 1337,
	"name": "Apple",
	"price": 1
}
```
**Focus on the building blocks** of the **HTTP response** and map each of them to the code that appears to handle them.
With this **approach**, you can intuitively **work out the patterns** of any **framework** to sufficiently **map out** the **web attack surface** based on reachable
**routes**.
You can also **save a lot of time and effort** by reading the **documentation**, if any is **available**, of the **particular framework** the application uses.


### >  Nontraditional Web Attack Surfaces

`HTTP` **endpoints** is **not** the **only attack surface**  that can be **used** in **software application** context.  

It may use **protocols** or **formats** like **Web Distributed Authoring and
Versioning** (`WebDAV`) or **Really Simple Syndication** (`RSS`) that build upon
or **extend** `HTTP` or other **web-related protocols**, such as `WebSocket`, **Web
Real-Time Communication** (`WebRTC`), and many more.

This **means** you should **think beyond** traditional **web attack vectors**.

**Additionally**, a **web attack surface** doesn’t mean you should look only
for **web vulnerabilities** like **SQL injection**.

For example, at `Pwn2Own` **Tokyo 2019**, the **security researcher** known as "d4rkn3ss" **exploited** a 
classic **heap overflow vulnerability** in the **httpd** web service of the 	`NETGEAR Nighthawk R6700v3` **[router](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2020/6/24/zdi-20-709-heap-overflow-in-the-netgear-nighthawk-r6700-router)**

Due to the **limited compute and storage** available on **smart devices**, it’s
actually **quite rare** to find fully fledged **web frameworks** running on these
devices.

Instead, you’re more likely to find **compiled binaries** that include
both the **web server** and **application logic**.

This increases the **possibility** of
**discovering classic** **non-web vulnerabilities** like **memory corruption** even in
the **web components**.   
It also means that your **approach** toward **analyzing** the
**web attack surface** of **firmware** will involve **binary analysis** techniques like
**reverse engineering** rather than **source code** analysis.

**Some applications** may spin up **temporary web servers** for **inter-process**
communication. **Software** sometimes **requires** users to **sign in via the browser**
as part of an **OAuth flow**.
Exemple :

The **GitHub command line interface** (`CLI`) tool can **trigger a web app OAuth**
login flow via the `github.com/cli/oauth` package, which starts a **local `HTTP`
server** before opening a **web browser** to the initial **OAuth web URL**.

> oauth_webapp.go

```golang

// 2024 GitHub, Inc.
package oauth

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"net/http"

	"github.com/cli/browser"
	"github.com/cli/oauth/api"
	"github.com/cli/oauth/webapp"
)

// WebAppFlow starts a local HTTP server, opens the web browser to initiate the OAuth Web application
// flow, blocks until the user completes authorization and is redirected back, and returns the access token.
func (oa *Flow) WebAppFlow() (*api.AccessToken, error) {
	host := oa.Host

	if host == nil {
		parsedHost, err := NewGitHubHost("https://" + oa.Hostname)
		if err != nil {
			return nil, fmt.Errorf("error parsing the hostname '%s': %w", oa.Hostname, err)
		}
		host = parsedHost
	}

	flow, err := webapp.InitFlow()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	params := webapp.BrowserParams{
		ClientID:    oa.ClientID,
		RedirectURI: oa.CallbackURI, //1
		Scopes:      oa.Scopes,
		Audience:    oa.Audience,
		AllowSignup: true,
	}
	browserURL, err := flow.BrowserURL(host.AuthorizeURL, params)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	go func() {
		_ = flow.StartServer(oa.WriteSuccessHTML)
	}()

	browseURL := oa.BrowseURL
	if browseURL == nil {
		browseURL = browser.OpenURL
	}

	err = browseURL(browserURL)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("error opening the web browser: %w", err)
	}

	httpClient := oa.HTTPClient
	if httpClient == nil {
		httpClient = http.DefaultClient
	}

	return flow.Wait(context.TODO(), httpClient, host.TokenURL, webapp.WaitOptions{ //2
		ClientSecret: oa.ClientSecret,
	})
}
```

After the user has successfully **authenticated** in the **browser**, the flow
**redirects** to the `callback URL` (`//1`) at the local **HTTP server** with the temporary authorization code and state.
The program then uses an **HTTP client** (`//2`) to make a `POST` **request** to the **GitHub OAuth** service’s **token endpoint** and
exchanges the **authorization code** for an **access token**.

In summary, the **web attack surface** covers a large variety of functionality, from **clients to servers**.


## Network Protocols

**Software** can use many other **network protocols** than **HTTP** to **communicate over networks**.

The **[Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc793.html)** (`TCP/IP`) model **organizes the communication protocols** between **systems in four layers**:

**Application** Handles communication between applications (for example, `HTTP`, `DNS`, and `FTP`)
**Transport** Handles communication between hosts (`TCP` and `UDP`)
**Internet** Handles communication between networks (`IP` and `ICMP`)
**Link** Handles communication between physical devices (`MAC`)

Most **software**
defers the handling of **data** at the **lower layers** to operating system **APIs** or
**standard libraries**; discovering a **vulnerability** at these levels will create an
**extensive impact**.

The **majority of code** you will encounter deals with the **application layer**,
such as the `dhcp6relay` server in **SONiC** (see [Chapter 1](https://tednoob17.github.io/posts/from-day0-to-0day-chapter-1/)). Since `SONiC` is built
to **run** on **networking devices** like **switches**, it’s a useful **reference** for **mapping** a **software’s network protocol attack surface**.
To **identify potential** **network protocol attack vectors**, start with the most
**basic API calls**: opening a **network socket**, **listening to it**, and **receiving data**.

Exemple :  
> "The Inter-Chassis Communication Protocol ([ICCP](https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-buildimage/blob/ba30775d65e95376d17a4a9ed696c12b6de69dc5/src/iccpd/src/scheduler.c)) server initialization code"

```c
/* Server socket initialization */
void scheduler_server_sock_init()
{
int optval = 1;
struct System* sys = NULL;
struct sockaddr_in src_addr;

if ((sys = system_get_instance()) == NULL)
	return;
sys->server_fd = socket(PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0); //1
bzero(&(src_addr), sizeof(src_addr));
src_addr.sin_family = PF_INET;
src_addr.sin_port = htons(ICCP_TCP_PORT); //2
src_addr.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY; //3

--snip--

if (bind(sys->server_fd, (struct sockaddr*)&(src_addr), sizeof(src_addr)) < 0)
{
	ICCPD_LOG_INFO(__FUNCTION__, "Bind socket failed. Error");
	return;
}

```
> The `[iccpd]` server initialization code

- (`//1`) : `PF_INET` refer to **IPV4** internet protocol, the next argument, `SOCK_STREAM` define the socket type (in this case is TCP)
- (`//2`) : The next line specify that socket use open port `ICCP_TCP_PORT` (`8888`) who is defined in [iccp_github_code](https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-buildimage/blob/ba30775d65e95376d17a4a9ed696c12b6de69dc5/src/iccpd/include/iccp_csm.h)
- (`//3`) : YOu can see that port is opened on `INADDR_ANY`, means that **IP addresses**  associated with the system running the program.

The [RFC](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc-index.html) (Request for Comments) **documented** any of **standart protocol** like `tcp/ip`, `iccpd`, etc..., 
they are published by [IETF](https://www.ietf.org) (Internet Engineering Task Force). Their **role** is to  **describes** the **design and implementation** of the **protocol**.

Read **RFC** can be a starting point when you **targeting** a **software** who **implement the specific protocols**

Often when the **protocol** is **proprietary**  niche enough to require a tailor-made approch, the **developpers** can write her own **custom implementation** , who will surely **less tested** than **open source protocols**.

When reviewing **code for a protocol**, focus on **two main features**: the
**data structures** and the **procedures**.


### Data Structures

The **data structures** define how **data** is **formatted and parsed in a network** protocol.

- Exemple:   
When you check  `AgentX`(Agent Extensibility Protocol) who is **a networking protocol that enables a single SNMP master agent to manage multiple subagents**

It was inplemented on [sonic-snmpagent](https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-snmpagent/blob/4622b8df01e6cfa818568b5a78a1a56ab555097d/src/ax_interface/pdu.py)  and documented in [RFC 2741](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2741.txt)
The "**Protocol Definition**" section defines the `AgentX` **protocol data unit** (PDU) header.

```md

6. Protocol Definitions

6.1. AgentX PDU Header

   The AgentX PDU header is a fixed-format, 20-octet structure:

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |   h.version   |    h.type     |    h.flags    |  <reserved>   |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                          h.sessionID                          |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                        h.transactionID                        |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                          h.packetID                           |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                        h.payload_length                       |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   An AgentX PDU header contains the following fields
```

The maintainer define a `PDUHeaderTags class` with a `from_bytes` :

> `sonic-snmpagent/src/ax_interface/pdu.py`


```python
class PDUHeaderTags(namedtuple('_PDUHeaderTags', ('version', 'type_', 
							'flags', 'reserved'))):
	--snip--
	@classmethod
	def from_bytes(cls, byte_string):
		return cls(
			*struct.unpack('!BBBB', byte_string[:4])
		)
```
Here is use `!BBBB` , mean that the **bytes or octet** should be interpreted in **network byte order** (**[big-endian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness)**) as four **1-byte unsigned chars**.
The `PDUHeaderTags` instance respect the descriptions in the **RFC**, if the differences between the implementation and
of **data stuctures** (in the `code`) and the **expected format** required the **vulnerabilities can occurs**.

![alt](/images/stc/endianess-1.png)


Ex :
In `dhcpv6relay` protocol implentation the `option->option_length` variable is parsed like a **unsigned 16 bit integer** (`short` type) who normaly have `65635` for maximum value.
before using it as **number of bytes** to copy into a fixed buffer of size `4096`.


### Procedures
A **network protocol’s** procedures define the rules and conventions of communication.
These procedures include the expected order and actions taken by clients or servers.

When a `data structures` vulnerability lead to **memory corruption** issues, `procedures` problems do to **higher-level business logic** 
such as **authentication and authorization**.  

Knowing **what constitutes a security boundary** in a **network protocol** is
**necessary** to correctly **identify a business logic vulnerability**.

Exemple of procedures :
- **Handshaking:** *Initially* **exchanging messages** in order to **establish communication**.
- **Session management:** **Tracking individual sessions** between the two entities.
- **State management:** **Controlling the state** of an individual session.
- **Flow control:** Managing the **rate and order of data transmission**.
- **Error handling:** Performing **recovery or termination** from **invalid data**.
- **Encryption:** Ensuring the **privacy**, **authenticity**, and **integrity** of communication.
- **Session termination:** Performing **teardown** and **cleanup** of the **session** in an orderly manner.

YOu can see by example of **procedures** describes in any rfc like `rfc 2741` in section `7` (`Elements of Pro-
cedure.`)



### Local Attack Surface
Network Protocols like (`TCP`, `UDP`, `SCTP`) deal with **communication between different machines** (over the **internet** or **local network**).
When program or **different part** of the **same program running on your computer** `IPC` is the way these **different programs**  can talk to **each other and share information** 
on that **one computer**. `IPC`  can happen **between** different **processes** or between **threads** within the same process.
Network protocols are for computers talking to other computers, while IPC is for programs talking to each other on the same computer.

`AgentX` can operate over the network and via `IPC`.
**the attacker’s perspective**, **network transport protocols** expose
a **remote attack vector**, while **local transport protocols** expose a (**surprise!**) **local attack vector**.
Why ? Because `AgentX` **subagents** to communicate with the **master agent** on the **same host**, `RFC 2741` suggests local mechanisms such as shared memory,
**named pipes**, and **sockets**. This opens up a whole new attack surface for the
**same protocol**.

### > Files in Inter-Process Communication
From sockets to devices, developers can expose many input/output resources
using files to provide a common set of channels to work with.

When you `IPC` file exchange or file to exchange data between two process, the disk I/O is required for some action.


One exemple for this is to use `lock files` who indicates that a **another process** used this file, it can help to 
prevent that **multiple instance** of the **same file** was running.
Real exemple is when you use editor like **vim** in two different terminal to modify a file, it show you a **warning**
showing you that another process already used this file (but here `vim` used `.swap` for temporary save data).


- Real life example: Exploiting a Hardcoded Path in Apport

One **implementation** of **lock files** led to an interesting **privilege escalation vulnerability** 
`(CVE-2020-8831)` in **Ubuntu** via the `Apport` program.
The code causing this vulnerability lay in the [check_lock](https://github.com/canonical/apport/blob/44a97a8/data/apport),
function.

```python3
def check_lock():
	'''Abort if another instance of apport is already running.
	This avoids bringing down the system to its knees if there is a series of
	crashes.'''
	# create lock file directory
	try:
		os.mkdir("/var/lock/apport", mode=0o744) //1
	except FileExistsError:
		pass
	# create a lock file
	try:
		fd = os.open("/var/lock/apport/lock", os.O_WRONLY | os.O_CREAT | os.O_NOFOLLOW) //2
	except OSError as e:
		error_log('cannot create lock file (uid %i): %s' % (os.getuid(), str(e)))
		sys.exit(1)

def error_running(*args):
	error_log('another apport instance is already running, aborting')
	sys.exit(1)

original_handler = signal.signal(signal.SIGALRM, error_running)
signal.alarm(30) # timeout after that many seconds
try:
	fcntl.lockf(fd, fcntl.LOCK_EX) //3
except IOError:
	error_running()
finally:
	signal.alarm(0)
	signal.signal(signal.SIGALRM, original_handler)

```

- In `check_lock` function the lock file in create if doesn't exit (`//1`).
- After it trying to acquire a lock file using a POSIX compliant API call who allow developers to implement lock files
in a more standized way. (`//3`).
- `O_NOFOLLOW` : In `man 2 open` it describe that "If the **trailing component** (i.e., basename) of pathname is  a  **symbolic  link**,
then  the open fails, with the error `ELOOP`.  **Symbolic links** in earlier **components of the pathname** will still be **followed**." 
 So with the hardcoded path  `/var/lock/apport/lock` who have `lock` like **basename**, an **attacker** could use a symlink to redirect the program
 to **read from or write to** a **different destination** that the program has access to.

This is the problem: if any other component in 	`/var/lock/apport/lock`
other than **lock** is a symlink, Apport will still happily follow it. In the case of
Ubuntu, `/var/lock` is a symlink to `/run/lock`, which is **readable and writable** by
all users. As such, an **attacker** can create a **symlink** at `/var/lock/apport` pointing 
to any other directory, and if `Apport` runs afterward, it will create a **lock
file** in the **attacker-controlled** destination.


### > Sockets  
 
A **socket** is an **endpoint that allows communication between processes**.
It a one of the **more common IPC channels** and hence present a rich **source of potential attack vectors**.

**Unix OS** support **Unix domain sockets** (`UDS`s), a local variant (`TCP`, `UDP`, `SCTP`), but UDS don't take care of protocol layer and run fast.
The socket respect the "**everything is file**" Unix philosophy so expose a `UDS`s in a **filesystem pathname** can lead to **namespaces hijacking**
or **access control** due to **inappropriate file permissions**.  
Ex : A `CVE-2022-21950` was a **vulnerability** in **Canna**, a Japanese Kana–Kanji
server, that arose from the **hardcoded directory** `/tmp/.iroha_unix` containing
the `UDS` used by **Canna** in `openSUSE` OS.

### > Named Pipes
**Named pipes** are another means by which **processes** can **communicate** using a **file-like** paradigm.
However, on **Windows**, **named pipes** have their own
**access control model** separate from the **default filesystem**, creating an **additional layer** of potential **authorization** issues.

Take, for example, a **high-privileged program** that creates a **named pipe**
server and client for `IPC`. If a **low-privileged attacker** creates the **named pipe**
server **before the program does**, it could potentially **intercept messages** from
the **client**.
Worse, if the **client** makes use of the server’s responses to **execute
actions** such as **running commands**, it could lead to **privilege escalation**.


This was the case for `CVE-2022-21893`, a **privilege escalation** exploit in **Windows Remote Desktop**
Mapping **Code to Attack** Surface Services (`RDS`) that **allowed** an attacker to **intercept the messages** of `RDS`
**named pipe** `IPC`.

### > Other IPC Methods

The number of `IPC` **methods** is constantly growing as **operating systems** and
**third-party software** add **features**. The following is a **nonexhaustive** list:
- Shared memory
- System signal
- Message queue
- Memory-mapped file
- Remote procedure call
- Component Object Model (COM, Windows only)
- Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE, Windows only)
- Clipboard
- D-Bus (Linux only)
- MailSlot (Windows only)

Developers use these `APIs` in **creative** (and potentially **insecure**) ways.

### File Formats
Almost all software needs to **handle files**. From newline-delimited configuration files to video clips, we encode data in a variety of formats. Like **protocols**, **file formats** require software to **parse** **data structures** in a standard manner.
Many **file formats** are **documented** in `RFC`s, but **proprietary or older
formats** may require more digging.
For example, **file formats** are often **roughly divided into three parts**:

- **Header:** Appears at the start of the file and usually **begins** with a set of
**unique bytes** so software can **identify** the file format.
- **Body:** Contains the main data associated with the **format**, often grouped
into **chunks** for software to parse easily.
- **Footer:** Contains additional **metadata**, such as **checksums** to ensure
**data integrity**.

Other formats **diverge** even further from the **header-body-footer** pattern, such as **directory-based** formats, which **organize data** into multiplefiles within a **directory structure**.

For example, **Microsoft Office** documents (such as .docx and .pptx files) are essentially **ZIP** containing
**resource and metadata** files such as `XML` **documents**, **images**, and so on.

### > Type–Length–Value
The **type–length–value** (`TLV`) pattern **occurs** in both **protocols and file formats**. We use `TLV` for **chunked data** in the body because its **structure** allows
a parser to **easily identify** and consume **chunks of variable length**.

### > Directory-Based

A significant subset of **file formats** are **directory-based**, meaning the file is actually a **wrapper** around many other files.
Like `ZIP`, `DEB` .
Typically, **directory-based formats**
require a **manifest** (`manifest.xml`) that **contains additional metadata** about the rest of the
files, including where they’re located. This pattern **tends to expose two types
of vulnerabilities**, related to **file traversal** and **child format.**

- **File traversal** occurs if the software **insecurely parses** the directory data.
A **parser** that **trusts** such a **value** could extract files into **dangerous locations**,
such as **cron job** folders or **application working directories**.
- **Child format**–related **vulnerabilities** occur because **developers** tend to
**focus on the parent directory–based** format and **delegate** handling **child
file formats** to external libraries, which may **not parse** securely by default.

Sometimes, both types of vulnerabilities occur in the same software.
[Example of vuln](https://spaceraccoon.dev/a-tale-of-two-formats-exploiting-insecure-xml-and-zip-file-parsers-to-create-a/)

### Custom Fields

File formats often include **reserved bytes** or **extendable fields** that allow developers to add **custom functionality**.
Sometimes, developers jerry-rig custom fields by parsing data differently
from how a standard defines it.
Thus, to indicate a stylesheet located at main.css, an HTML document could
include the following element:
```html
<link href="main.css" rel="stylesheet">
```
However, the **WeasyPrint** `HTML-to-PDF` conversion **engine** extends the function of `<link>` by supporting a **custom attachment**
value for `rel` that doesn’t appear in the **HTML standard**. By using this value,
a developer can include local files as **attachments** to the output PDF:

```html
<link href="file:///etc/passwd" rel="attachment">
```
This is a **feature**, **not a vulnerability in itself**, but a developer that uses
**WeasyPrint** without accounting for this behavior could introduce a **vulnerability** in their software.
